#+TITLE: saveplace-pdf-view

=saveplace-pdf-view= adds support for pdf-view buffers (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]])
in the built-in mode =save-place=.  This will store the place
(e.g. the current page and zoom) of PDF buffers under =pdf-view-mode=,
and revisiting the PDF files later will restore the saved place.

Note: This won't work with =doc-view-mode=.

- pdf-view-restore ([[https://github.com/007kevin/pdf-view-restore][Link]]):
  - From code review (commit 5a1947c): For each PDF file you visit in
    Emacs, =pdf-view-restore= will persist the last viewed page in a
    separate file.  This file is stored relative to the PDF file
    location.
  - =saveplace-pdf-view= (this package) persists other information
    like the scale amount and scroll position in addition to the last
    viewed page of the PDF file.  It saves those information through
    =save-place=, an Emacs built-in for saving and restoring "places"
    you visit.
