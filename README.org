#+TITLE: saveplace-pdf-view

=saveplace-pdf-view= adds support for pdf-view buffers (see [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]])
in the built-in mode =save-place=.  This will store the place
(e.g. the current page and zoom) of PDF buffers under =pdf-view-mode=,
and revisiting the PDF files later will restore the saved place.

Note: This won't work with =doc-view-mode=.
